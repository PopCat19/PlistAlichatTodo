Profile
A member of the Justice Actualization Committee of Trinity Academy, Ichika always has a calm expression on her face. As a member of the Justice Actualization Committee, she is primarily in charge of mediation between students. Ichika maintains coirdial relationships with other schools as well. Her amiable personality should not be mistaken for something innate, it is a conscious result of continuous work.

Introduction
Ichika (or mononymously Chika) is a member of the Justice Realization Committee. Although she seems pretty easygoing and laid back in her mannerisms, she takes her duties quite seriously.

Personality
A seemingly calm and laid-back girl who doesn't seem to show much concern on most occasions. At best, she would only mention what's wrong with the situation because most of the time, the situation goes wrong before she can do anything about it, one example being Kenzaki Tsurugi mindlessly bashing through walls.

However, behind those closed eyes of hers lies a destructive personality that lays hidden until Ichika's patience breaks. When that happens, Ichika's destructiveness can possibly even parallel Tsurugi's. She is not one to be underestimated.

Appearance
Ichika has straight, black, waist length hair with a pair of long sidebangs on the front. She wears two different hair pins on the left side of her hair. She has grey eyes, and a pair of black-feathered angel wings.

Halo
Her halo is a pair of two red circles, one smaller than the other, with four arrows pointing from the center towards four outward directions, seemingly forming a crosshair.

Uniform
She wears the usual Justice Realization Committee uniform - A black sailor shirt with a red strip on the pleated skirt and sleeves, and a red armband, the word "Justice" imprinted on it, and a red ribbon with choker on the neck. A pair of black shortgloves are found on her hands. She wears a pair of black shoes and socks along with the uniform.

Firearm
She uses a black Enfield EM-2 experimental bullpup assault rifle with red furniture.
