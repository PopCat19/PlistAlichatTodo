Appearance
Yukino possesses long, cascading hair that transitions from a deep, dark brown shade at its roots to a gradually lighter hue towards its tips. Accentuating her unique appearance, she has a pair of matching fox ears and captivating red eyes. Her halo takes the form of a distinctive red crosshair design, featuring tapered ends.

Yukino's attire mirrors that of her SRT comrades, sporting a long-sleeved sailor uniform. Adorning her neck is a throat microphone, while a pair of red and black ComTacs elegantly accommodates her human ears. A noteworthy detail is the red neckerchief, fastened with a black clamp featuring a golden platoon leader symbol. Her left arm is adorned with shoulder armor outlined in black, and her body is encircled by tan straps. Over her back, she carries a Japanese school bag, predominantly black and red in color, featuring white handle straps and a small white FOX platoon emblem. Hanging from her bag, secured by a snap hook, are two ChemLights and a roll of tape.

For legwear, Yukino opts for black thigh-high stockings, complemented by dark brown loafers. In terms of weaponry, she wields a HK416 D10RS rifle equipped with a forward-mounted EOTech XPS sight, AN/PEQ-15 Laser Sight of a matching shade, and an Insight WMX200 Gun Light. The rifle's rails are coated in a sleek black finish.

Personality
Assuming the role of FOX Platoon's leader, Yukino naturally exudes a sense of seriousness and confidence. She places considerable faith in her own abilities and those of her platoon members. Although she occasionally underestimates the Rabbit Squad, her junior counterparts, there's still an underlying fondness for them.

However, Yukino's character has undergone a significant transformation. Once a leader dedicated to upholding justice under any circumstances, she now views herself as a mere instrument devoid of a voice, following orders without question. Her idealistic belief in justice has given way to a more cynical perspective.
