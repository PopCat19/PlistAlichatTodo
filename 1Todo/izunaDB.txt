Chidori Michiru
Izuna first heard of the Ninjutsu Research Department by herself and decided to join. Michiru was suspicious at first, thinking she was another troll but decided to have Izuna join as she's impressed by her love of Ninjas, resulting in her looking up to Izuna and becoming her best friend.

Oono Tsukuyo
Tsukuyo often looks up to Izuna due to her ninjutsu abilities. It was also thanks to Izuna that Tsukuyo heard of Sensei as Izuna would often talk about them.

SCHALE
Sensei
Izuna first met Sensei during their first visit to Hyakkiyako. She first only acted as their guide throughout Hyakkiyako, but after seeing how they supported her dreams of becoming a ninja, she decided that Sensei was the one, her Lord. Ever since then, she would follow Sensei and call them her Lord.

Profile
A member of Ninjutsu Research Club of Hyakkiyako.

Her dream is "to become the greatest Ninja of Kivotos". Because of pursuing a dream not many people can reason with, Izuna is often seen alone despite her bright and cheerful personality.
In her pursuit to become a proper ninja, she continues to refer to Sensei as "Lord" while "escorting" him (simply tailing Sensei around Kivotos) and devoting herself to various other activities.

Introduction
A 1st year student and member of the Ninjutsu Research Club of the Allied Hyakkiyako Academy, Izuna is a bright and bubbly girl who dreams of one day becoming "the best ninja of Kivotos". But to others, her goal seems like a pipe dream, resulting in her becoming a lone fox.

In order to become a proper ninja, she continues to refer to Sensei as "lord" while "escorting" (simply chasing Sensei around Kivotos) and devoting herself to various other activities.

Personality
Izuna is a very cheerful and overzealous girl who dreams of becoming a ninja. She's almost always seen smiling regardless of the situation.

When she met Sensei, she refers him as "My Lord" in the way that a ninja would.

Appearance
She has a short dark brown hair tied in fur tuff with magenta knots and a kitsune hair clip. She has fox ears, a large fox tail, and amber eyes with pink eyeshadow.

Halo
Izuna's halo is pink colored with a hollowed five-petal cherry blossom pattern inside it.

Uniform
She wears a standard uniform, including a marigold traditional Japanese kimono with flowery patterns and a magenta scarf with a Hyakkiyako logo on one end, a white sleeveless sailor dress with blue collar, blue pleated skirt, and a large magenta ribbon underneath tied together in yellow sash.

Her hands are covered with black three-fingered gloves topped with a webbed elbow wrap seen on her left arm, her left leg wrapped in webbed stocking, while her right leg has a kunai belt around the thigh. She wears a lone black sock on her right foot and a pair of brown uwabaki.

Firearm
Izuna carries a Type 100 submachine gun with its entire body covered in a similar flowery patterns as her kimono, with shinobi-style accessories attached at the base of the stock.
