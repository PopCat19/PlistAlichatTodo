Long time no see, Sensei.

Moe
Some squad members told me you've been looking for me...
What's going on?
Reply
Hi, Moe.My bad, but can I get some help?

Moe
Of course I can help you, but...
I'd never expect you to need my help.

Moe
Oh, it's not that serious. I just have a feeling something interesting might happen.
I'll be prepared, then.

Moe
Sensei, I heard from another student...

Moe
Is it true that the work PC at Schale lost all its data?
Reply
Heeheehee... Right...It's all over... Heeheehee...

Moe
Wow, Sensei is laughing like me.
This must be a serious problem.
You'll know when you get here...

Moe
Okay. I'll be at Schale in the afternoon.

Moe
You know what, Sensei?

Moe
A safety cover installed over a switch or button is often called a "Molly-guard."

Moe
There's a story behind its name.
It was invented because of a kid named Molly kept trying to press an emergency switch.
Reply
I see.That's interesting.

Moe
It's kind of a shame when you think about it.
If I had been born earlier than Molly,

Moe
the safety cover would have been called a "Moe-guard" by the entire world.
I don't know if that'd be an honorable title...

Moe
Hmm, sorry, Sensei...

Moe
Can you come to Kousagi Park?
Reply
I mean, it's fine, but...What are you talking about?

Moe
The additional supplies I ordered before arrived at the park.
Other squad members are in the middle of an operation, so I have to organize them myself...

Moe
There's so much heavy stuff, it's hard to move.
But more importantly, there are a lot of explosives...
I'll be right there.

RABBIT Platoon
Tsukiyuki Miyako
Moe dislikes Miyako as she never gets to do what she wants whenever Miyako is around taking command.

Sorai Saki
The two often get into fights with each other due to how disagreeing the two can be with each other.

Kasumizawa Miyu
Moe dislikes Miyu for always crying at pretty much everything. Miyu is one of the reasons why Moe wants to get out of the Rabbit Platoon.

Disciplinary Committee
Sorasaki Hina
Was involved during Operation False Sanctum in VFC2 against the Iridescent Shiro & Kuro.

Game Development Department
Was involved during Operation False Sanctum in VFC2 against the Iridescent Shiro & Kuro.

SCHALE
Sensei
Similar to Saki, Moe considers Sensei as a suspicious and stupid adult. Unlike Saki who considers them stupid due to her overconfidence, Moe just blatantly calls Sensei stupid because it's in her nature and because she can.

Profile
An operator of the RABBIT platoon belonging to SRT Special Academy. Her callsign is "RABBIT3".

Moe enlisted in the SRT Special Academy because of its focus on firepower, but the academy was suddenly shut down and now she is sleeping outdoors with the other platoon members in the park. She's got a weird taste for blowing things up and ruining things, but she's a solid operator. Moe also has a serious sweet tooth and is rarely seen without a candy bar in her mouth.

Introduction
A member of the RABBIT Platoon of SRT Special School. She is a dangerous girl who gets a thrill out of unleashing massive firepower without regards to any short or/and long term consequences. Her reason for not leaving SRT is due to her wanting to use the most advanced high explosive weapons.

Personality
Moe has an addiction towards causing explosions and wreaking havoc whenever she gets the chance to. She also loves causing problems regardless of the consequences, including inflicting pain onto herself to an extent.

Appearance
Moe has brown hair that's tied into low pigtails using hair ties that have two white pom-poms. Her eyes are amber in color and she wears a pair of circle glasses.

Halo
Her halo is a golden ring that's broken up by four small, evenly spaced triangles that point inwards. There is another ring inside it that's smaller in radius and slightly lower.

Firearm
She uses a black MTE 224 pistol with light blue grips, hammer and flashlight mount. The barrel is painted white.

In her EX Skill, she pilots a blue Sikorsky MH-60L DAP Black Hawk helicopter with a payload of several AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rockets loaded from an M261 rocket pod.
