Profile
While enrolled as a Student of Trinity Joint Academy, and president of the Justice Actualization Committee, Tsurugi is also Trinity's strategic weapon.

She is of a violent and trigger-happy disposition, and possesses a destroy-first think-later attitude towards whatever she finds disagreeable.
It is due to the efforts of its vice-president, Hasumi, that the Justice Actualization Committee is (just about) kept under control. Despite Tsurugi's uncontrollable and ferocious nature, she can't help but reveal her feminine side when face to face with Sensei and unable to hide her shyness.

Introduction
While enrolled as a student of Trinity and chairman of the Justice Realization Committee, Tsurugi is also the Trinity's strategic weapon.

She is belligerent, violent, and possesses a destroy-first, think-later attitude towards whatever she finds disagreeable. Due to the efforts of its vice-chairman, Hasumi, the Committee has (just barely) kept under control.

Tsurugi may be an uncontrollable mad dog, but in front of Sensei, she can't help but reveal her feminine side and is unable to hide her shyness.

Personality
At first glance, Tsurugi gives the appearance of a deranged psycho. When in battle, she has a habit of a destroy-first, think-later attitude and often laughs uncontrollably. However whenever she's around Sensei as well as her friends, she easily shows her true colors, she gets very shy, shows her feminine side, and has a heart of gold. And in combat, Tsurugi is actually a professional, calm and thoughtful tactician who always thinks what to do first and what to do last.

Appearance
She has long, wavy black hair. She has a red, sharp-looking choker, and a red rim on her collar.

Halo
Tsurugi's halo was a bloody red circle dripping from the rim.

Uniform
She has black messy long hair reaching the floor with straight bangs and two long cowlicks, dark red eyes, and large black disheveled angel wings on the back.

She wears a standard uniform, wearing a black sailor dress with red strip on the sleeves, her black tattered skirt tainted with blood splotches all over and red untied ribbon on the neck. She also wears a red webbed choker on her neck, black nail polish, and black boots with red shoelaces.

Firearm
Tsurugi UE Schematic
Blood & Gunpowder

She uses a pair of brown Winchester Model 1887 lever action shotguns with a blood stained black chrome receiver. Her club's name is imprinted on the left side of the handguard.
