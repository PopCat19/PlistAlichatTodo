Introduction
A member of the Seven Prisoners who escaped the Corrections Bureau, known for a past incident where many were injured and vehicles were destroyed, all caused by her alone. However, she got snitched on by the Helmet Gang prior to her apprehension. Now that she's free with the help of the Smiling Professor, she plans to exact her revenge on the Helmet Gangsters, in the name of the Sukeban Gangsters.

Personality
Contrasting her barbaric appearance, Akemi actually possesses a level of elegance, making her appearance grand as if she's a long-awaited guest in a party. She even calls her gun "Elizabeth" and has a pet flying squirrel named "Charles".

Appearance
Akemi is a quite tall and really muscular woman. She has long, blonde glamour side-swept curls. She has grey eyes and a mole under her left eye.

Halo
Akemi has a dark red halo. Her halo has six kite-shaped figures, and between each of them is a small kite-shaped figure.

Uniform
Akemi is topless, wearing only a sarashi as a top. She wears a long, red pleated skirt with some Japanese symbols written in gold. The skirt is held up by some black belts and a chain that hangs loosely on one side. As footwear she wears, white high heeled boots.

Firearm
She uses a black Browning M2HB Heavy Machine gun with a missing ammunition belt. She also has an loaded olive M202 FLASH incendiary multiple rocket launcher.

Trivia
Written on her skirt are the characters:
威血婆云乃恶上沙魔
天下無敵須怪婆云
我絶死覇火我威々
These can roughly be decoded based on their readings to:

一番のお嬢様 (The most beautiful girl)
天下無敵スケバン (The invincible sukeban)
私は可愛い (I'm cute)
