Supplementary Lessons Department
Urawa Hanako
Due to Hanako's sexual joke being thrown around her especially when Sensei is around. Koharu often tries to get away from Hanako or shut her up, often getting herself into trouble in the process.

Shirasu Azusa
Koharu often considers Azusa's actions to be inappropriate although Azusa only tries to do things more efficiently.

Ajitani Hifumi
Another member of the Supplementary Lessons Department.

Justice Realization Committee
Hanekawa Hasumi
Koharu seems to look up to Hasumi so much despite Hasumi only being the vice president of the Justice Task Force.

Tea Party
Misono Mika
In V3C3E17, during Mika's imprisonment, a group of Tea Party members tried to attack Mika, only to be stopped by Koharu with Sensei appearing not too long after. In V3C4E26, Koharu managed to save some of Mika's accessories that was supposed to be burnt during the Trinity students' protest, earning Mika's trust towards Koharu.

SCHALE
Sensei
Koharu's constant delusional fantasies of Sensei often get the better of her, much to Sensei's annoyance. Regardless of her tsundere-like attitude, she does call to Sensei for help when she needs it.

Profile
Koharu is a member of the Supplemental Lessons Club of Trinity General School.

Originally a member of the Justice Actualization Committee, she received failing grades and was in danger of repeating a year, so she was forcefully transferred to the Supplemental Lessons Club.
While she may consider herself elite, she is actually rather stupid, so much so in fact that she is completely unable to keep up with her lessons.
She has a secret hobby(?) of collecting lewd magazines, and often begins to fantasize about the most trivial things in everyday life, often to her own embarrassment.

Introduction
Member of the Supplementary Lesson Department of Trinity General Academy.

Originally, she belonged to the Justice Realization Committee, but her grades fell and she fell into a crisis of repeating a year and was forced to transfer to the remedial class department. She thinks she is an elite, but in reality, she is too stupid to keep up with her schoolwork. She has a hobby of collecting lewd magazines, and is often embarrassed to be alone with her fantasies about even the most trivial things.

Personality
Koharu is a naive and delusional young girl with a good heart, while her skills allowed her to become a part of the Justice Realization Committee. However, because of her stupidity and delusional behavior she is often set back.

Because of her delusions, she would believe that Sensei has sexual fantasies towards her that she denies having. However, beneath it all she is a dependable person who provides lighthearted banter and a springboard to bounce off of for the Supplementary Lesson Department.

Appearance
Koharu has pink eyes and pink hair with bangs that cover her forehead. Her hair is styled into two chest-length twintails by red ribbons, which also frames her face. She has crow-like wings on her head and lower back.

Halo
Koharu's halo consists of two pink rings that fade into a lighter tone downwards, with a pair of wings on top and a pair of bean-like shapes below.

Uniform
Koharu wears a black Trinity school uniform consisting of a black sailor-like sweater, a white and pink sailor collar, a pink sailor-like ribbon, a dark pink pleated skirt and white leg warmer socks. The sailor-like sweater is a bit loose on her left shoulder, revealing a white bra strap.

Firearm
Koharu UE Schematic
Justice Black

She uses a black Pattern 1914 Enfield bolt action battle rifle with pink retaining bands. A snail charm hangs on the forward rifle sling point. Her club's name is stamped on the receiver furniture. Her rifle is wrapped in a black shroud when not in use.
