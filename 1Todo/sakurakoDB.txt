Profile
A devout student of the Sisterhood belonging to Trinity Integrated Academy.

Sakurako is widely trusted by other students for her serious attitude. However, being too serious, she sometimes deviates from trends and common sense.

Introduction
The leader of the Sisterhood, Sakurako. As a sister, she's very helpful and is willing to listen to anyone. However, she mostly spends her time in the cathedral, not knowing of the current trends outside. This makes her feel more old-fashioned compared to the others, which makes her feel left out sometimes.

Personality
Sakurako has a very kind heart and is always willing to help, but she fears of being left out by the other Sisters due to not being up-to-date with the latest trends. She is also often misunderstood because of the way she acts.

Appearance
Sakurako has hip-length silver hair with bangs and magenta colored eyes.

Halo
Sakurako has a yellow halo that is formed by an upside-down semicircle flanked by two birds and another smaller semicircle with two triangles and a cross above it.

Uniform
Sakurako wears a black, nun-like dress with a white sailor collar and a light blue sailor ribbon. The dress includes a black skirt that starts below the chest and reaches mid-thigh, adorned with beautiful golden patterns. She also wears black thigh-high stockings and black boots. On her head, she wears a long nun headdress with golden accents.

Firearm
She uses a white IWI Tavor CTAR-21 assault rifle with an aquamarine grip. The magazine, charging handle, muzzle brake, fire selector switch, and trigger is painted gold. It is outfitted with flattop rails and a Manticore Arms Curved Buttpad. A golden bird acts in place as the front sight.
