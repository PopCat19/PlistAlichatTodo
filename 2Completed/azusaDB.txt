白洲アズサ。最近、トリニティ総合学園に転校してきたばかり。得意なことは単独行動。長所は小柄で隠れやすいところ…それぐらいかな。他に何か聞きたいことは？

I'm Shirasu Azusa, a transfer to Trinity. I work solo and can take cover easily due to my size. Any other questions?

Arius Squad
Joumae Saori
The person that basically saved Azusa's life. Azusa definitely owes Saori her life, although Azusa did find her rescue quite ludicrous. Azusa has always been trained by Saori ever since she brought Azusa into Arius Squad. Without Saori, Azusa probably wouldn't have even met Hifumi and the rest of the Supplementary Lesson Department. Even though Azusa eventually betrayed Saori, she still wishes Saori and Arius Squad safety and the best of luck.

Hakari Atsuko
Despite being unclear how their relationship is exactly, it's clear enough that Azusa and Atsuko are pretty close with each other. Even though the two ended up on different sides, Atsuko still shows concern for Azusa, and even tried to reason with her to return to Arius.

Tsuchinaga Hiyori
Back in Arius when she was little, Hiyori saw Azusa being beaten up. She wanted to help, but she was so scared she couldn't move. She was very worried that Azusa' halo was gonna break at that time.

Imashino Misaki
Misaki was also there when Azusa was being beaten up before she was rescued by Saori.

Supplementary Lessons Department
Ajitani Hifumi
If there's anything or anyone that made a significant impact on Azusa's life, it'd be Hifumi (without counting Sensei, who she seems to have a crush on). If it wasn't for Hifumi, Azusa would have never discovered enjoyment and purpose in life. It was also thanks to Hifumi that Azusa developed a liking towards Momo and Friends, especially towards Skullman. Azusa is also the main reason why Hifumi got Crusadie-chan.

Urawa Hanako
Being so used to life in Arius, Azusa tends to not understand some things in normal life. When it comes to Hanako though, it's probably best that Azusa stays that way. Seeing Hanako's indecent behavior, Azusa considers her suggestive movements as combat tactics although she sometimes doubts herself too as she thinks that Hanako makes way too many unnecessary movements for it to be called a tactic.

Shimoe Koharu
Although Azusa intends on doing things more efficiently, Koharu often considers her to be inappropriate. Once Azusa took a bath together with Koharu to conserve water, which was not welcomed by Koharu in any way.

Tea Party
Misono Mika
It was found that Mika was responsible for Azusa's registration to Trinity. Although her original plan was to use Azusa as a way for Trinity and Arius to make amends with each other, it quickly changed due to the Arius Squad having other plans and Mika's nature of not thinking clearly before making decisions. Fortunately, Azusa was quite forgiving as she learned to not keep hatred.

Yurizono Seia
Azusa was originally tasked to kill Seia as part of Mika's coup d'etat plan with Arius, but instead, she used that opportunity to ask Seia for advice. Azusa didn't want to be a murderer, so she wanted to ask Seia if there was any other way. Eventually, after an hour of talking, Azusa only hurt Seia and made it look like Seia was killed, which ended up working because even Mika and Arius believed it.

Kirifuji Nagisa
In V3C2E15, Azusa revealed herself to Nagisa as the traitor alongside Hanako. Azusa then fired a whole mag worth of ammo to knock out Nagisa to proceed with their plan in taking out the upcoming Arius attack.

Justice Realization Committee
Hanekawa Hasumi
During the Summer Sky's Wishlist event, Hasumi tasked Azusa and Hifumi to help give Tsurugi the vacation she needed by completing certain tasks. This acts as a way for Azusa and HIfumi to pay for their actions for stealing a tank.

Kenzaki Tsurugi
During the Summer Sky's Wishlist event, Azusa felt suspicious when Hasumi told them to go to the beach instead of an actual punishment. She thought that Hasumi had an ulterior motive, but she later found out that that's not true.

Shizuyama Mashiro
During the Summer Sky's Wishlist event, although Mashiro was supposed to be there to keep watch on Azusa, Hifumi, and Tsurugi, Azusa ended up having fun with Mashiro. The two built a whole fortress out of sand and had a sniping competition together.

The ice witch of Trinity's Supplemental Lessons Club.

For various reasons, she had dropped out of school and re-enrolled at Trinity. One to mainly keep to herself, she tends to voluntarily distance herself from others so as to not be a bother. This has led to others in the Supplemental Lessons club worrying for her.

Introduction
An ice queen who belongs to Trinity's Supplementary Lessons Department.

Originally, she had dropped out of her school, but for one reason or another, she has returned to school and is working on her schoolwork again. She is lonely, but she voluntarily keeps her distance for fear of bothering others and is worried by the students in Supplementary Lessons Department.

Personality
A cold person at the core, much of Azusa's aloof nature stems from her training under Arius and being raised as a weapon. Because of her dedication to the mission, she has no hobbies or any interests and does not make any attempts to befriend her classmates in the Supplementary Lessons Department. The training made her extremely adept at combat, having extensive knowledge on how to kill the other students by destroying their halos and lives a spartan lifestyle, focusing on her missions and studies ahead.

Through her experiences in the Supplementary Lessons Department, she learns to enjoy life and find purpose in her actions and develops a friendship with Hifumi and Sensei as a result. However, she still has an emotional conflict between her loyalty towards Arius Squad and the necessity of murdering them to prevent Trinity and to a lesser extent Kivotos from falling into ruin.

Appearance
She has long, silver hair. Her eyes are pink which fade into blue. Her hair is decorated with various purple floral accessories and a black ribbon.

Halo
Azusa's halo thematically takes after a woven laurel, portrayed as a yellow unclosed circle that resembles a crescent moon with various olive leaves.

Uniform
Azusa wears a collared white shirt and a long, black dress overtop with frills and flowers, and wears white-and-grey striped panties. She wears white-pointed shoes and black, cuffed socks. Over her uniform, she wears a long-sleeved, white capelet (which makes her outfit resemble a serafuku) with a yellow Trinity logo on her right sleeve, a yellow Arius logo on her left sleeve and a gold Arius brooch adorned with flowers in the front.

Firearm
Azusa UE Schematic
Et Omnia Vanitas

She uses a white SIG Sauer M400 rifle with a black pistol grip. The receiver is lined with gold accents. It is equipped with a Magpul MBUS rear sight, a black Magpul MOE M-LOK Handguard, and a White MOE Carbine Stock with gold on the inside perimeter. The Arius' motto "Vanitas Vanitatum, Et Omnia Vanitas" is on the Handguard imprinted in gold text. A similarly coloured Trinity insignia is imprinted beside it.
