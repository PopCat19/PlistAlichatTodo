Sensei, here's a picture of the rabbit we adopted.
This is how she sleeps after eating.
What a cute rabbit.

Right? Rabbits have a different charm from dogs or cats.
I'll take another picture when she wakes up for you.

By the way, I haven't decided on a name for her yet.

What kind of name would describe this adorable and brave rabbit?

That seems too fancy for a rabbit.
Do you like Bun Bun?

Yes, Sensei. A helicopter descent operation is scheduled today at 2200 hours.

The mission is to raid the smugglers who have been illegally bringing animals into Kivotos.
I'll come.

Miyako
This isn't something I had to think about while living at SRT,

Miyako
but extended camping is actually harder in the summer than the winter.
Why's that?

Miyako
The rainy seasons during the summer are more intense.
The constant downpour makes the equipment rust and food spoil so fast.
There's been a lot of different challenges...

Miyako
Especially trying to figure out how to dry our clothes...
Me and the other squad members are out of ideas. Our laundry's really piling up.
Why don't you just bring it to Schale?

Miyako
To Schale...?
We have a washing machine and dryer in the Schale lounge.
It'd only take around half a day.

Miyako
Oh... I appreciate the offer, but...
I mean...

Miyako
Well, I guess...just this once...
Okay. I'll be there soon.

RABBIT Platoon
Kasumizawa Miyu
Miyu mentioned that Miyako is almost always the one taking care of her, as the other two members often forget about her. Whenever Miyu wants to start crying, she often tells Miyako that she wants to go home.

Sorai Saki
Ever since SRT shut down, Saki doesn't like Miyako for taking command as Miyako is no longer the squad's leader and often brags that she can do things better than her.

Kazekura Moe
Since Moe prefers doing what she wants to do, she dislikes Miyako for taking command since her instructions sometimes contradict with what Moe wants to do.

Was involved during Operation False Sanctum in VFC2 against the Iridescent Shiro & Kuro.

Originally despising Sensei for foiling the Rabbit Squad's plans on protesting, now Miyako considers them a trustworthy person although she doesn't want to admit it straightforwardly.

Profile
Miyako is the leader of RABBIT platoon belonging to SRT Special Academy. She enrolled in the SRT Special Academy admiring the success of her seniors, only to find her school suddenly closed. She is now living in the park with fellow platoon members. Her facial expressions do not change much and she rarely shows her emotions, so people around Miyako tend to think that she is unsociable. However, deep down inside, she is always concerned about the members of her platoon and has a kind heart. Her callsign is "RABBIT1".

Introduction
Miyako is a member of SRT Special Academy and the leader of the RABBIT Platoon. Her facial expressions rarely change and she rarely shows her emotions. People around her tend to think she is unsociable, but in her heart, she is a kind-hearted platoon leader who is always concerned about her team members.

Advertisement
Personality
Leader of the Rabbit Platoon before SRT disbanded, she often takes initiative leading her squad in operations although they tend to not like being bossed around especially since their school has been shutdown. She tends to be expressionless, but she cares a lot for her team. She is also dedicated in her mission to restore SRT however she can, as daunting as the situation may seem.

Appearance
Miyako has thigh-length silver hair with bangs that frame her face and light magenta eyes. Part of her hair is tied by a black ribbon into a little side ponytail.

Halo
Miyako's cyan halo is formed by a circle within a slightly larger circle with four blunts and surrounded by eight jagged shapes.

Uniform
Miyako wears a sailor-like uniform that consists of a cyan crop sweater with large white sleeves, a bulletproof-like top with multiple pockets, a cyan and white pleated skirt, and a black corset-like cloth under her sweater. She also ears black knee pads, a pink sailor ribbon and a white sailor collar. Additionally, she wears white headphones reassembling two bunny ears atop her head.

Firearm
She uses a white Suomi KP/-31 with a navy blue receiver, barrel shroud, and suppressor. Rabbit Platoon decals are present on the suppressor and on the furniture.

In her memorial CG she is seen aboard the RABBIT Platoon's UH-60 Black Hawk presumably piloted by Moe. A GAU-21/A machine gun is also visible behind her installed on the aircraft's door mount.
