Appearance
Niko boasts a distinctive appearance, characterized by her pink bob-cut hair and matching fox ears. Her sky-blue eyes add to her unique charm. Her halo features an intricate design comprising four sky-blue loops that converge at the center to form a diamond shape, giving it the appearance of a cross with an additional small circle at its heart. Niko's attire adheres to the SRT standard, consisting of a long-sleeved sailor uniform. Around her neck, she wears a throat microphone connected to an orange walkie-talkie secured to her harness.

A noteworthy detail is the red neckerchief, fastened with a black clamp adorned with a golden platoon sergeant symbol. Her left arm showcases a red armband bearing the black FOX Platoon logo. She sports a black tactical harness around her body, complete with an orange walkie-talkie and a holster for her pistol. A white belt with a pouch is slung around her waist, and she carries a black and red Japanese school bag featuring white handle straps. Attached to one side of the bag's straps are two stun grenades. For legwear, Niko opts for black sheer tights paired with dark brown loafers. She also wears what appears to be a thigh holster on her left thigh.

Her weapon of choice is a two-tone Remington 870 MCS shotgun featuring a black barrel, tube magazine, cheek piece, and receiver. The forestock and stock are finished in rodeo dust. This shotgun is equipped with an EOTECH HWS 558 HOLOgraphic sight. Additionally, Niko carries several M84 stun grenades hanging from her carry bag.

Personality
Unlike her FOX Platoon comrades, who typically exhibit a more serious and rigid demeanor, Niko stands out as a warm-hearted and approachable individual. She holds a soft spot for the younger members of the team, particularly the Rabbit Squad, and readily extends her kindness to all. Niko is quite talkative and takes delight in crafting inarizushi, always eager to share her culinary creations with everyone.
