I don't remember agreeing to this...Ugh... It's so upsetting to hear that!

Michiru
Come on, Sensei... Did you forget?!
Late at night...under the moon, talking about ambushes...just you and me!

Michiru
Oh, just so you know, "ambush" is ninja slang for secretive movement in the bushes. Don't forget it!
I don't remember that at all! What ambush are you talking about?!

Michiru
Well, let's not worry about the details!
So, Michiru, why did you contact me today?

Oh! We're gonna miss the train!

Everything's related to ninjas, huh?!

Yeah.But it's an unofficial club. Is it okay to call yourself a president?

Michiru
Argh! What're you trying to say? Of course you can!
I work very hard all the time! Studying ninjas, creating content...

Michiru
If I keep up the good work, one day I'll be promoting ninjas to everyone in Kivotos and the Ninjutsu Research Club will be recognized as an official club!
Yeah, I know you're working hard, Michiru. You have my support.

Michiru
Wahaha! Thanks, Sensei! That means a lot to me.
I'm glad to hear that...

Michiru
I'm not just saying that. You have no idea how much you're helping me.
Your support is so powerful that all of my hesitation has completely disappeared!
Huh?

Michiru
I shouldn't hold back on investing into my efforts, right?
I hear new ninja merch arrived at one of my favorite stores.

Michiru
I-I mean, ninjutsu tools!

Michiru
The stuff is kind of expensive, so I was hesitant...but now I've changed my mind!
Yeah! It's an investment into my future!

Thing? What thing?

Michiru
The manga I always read. "Kama-Boko Gale Battle, Volume 19."
I searched the club room everywhere for it but couldn't find it. It's gotta be in the office.
When did you even bring it to Schale?

Michiru
Huh...? Well, our club room is temporary, and we don't know when those Hyakkaryouran jerks will invade.
The Yin-Yang Club also comes in and causes commotions.

Michiru
According to my ninja brain...
It only made sense to keep the precious item at Schale.
Schale is not a storage facility, Michiru...

Michiru
Oh! If you ever get bored, you should read it! I highly recommend the Kama-Boko series!
Also, I should remind you we're gathering at the park tonight. Don't forget!

Ninjutsu Research Department
Kuda Izuna
After hearing about the Ninjutsu Research Department, a club that researches ninjutsu, Izuna couldn't help but join. At first, Michiru was suspicious about her, but she noticed Izuna's capabilities and passion for ninjas that she decided to let her join. As a result, Michiru now looks up to Izuna and the two become good friends.

Oono Tsukuyo
Tsukuyo originally joined the club to due Michiru's invitation. Despite her low self-esteem however, she showed her dedication towards the art of ninjas thanks to Michiru comforting her. Eventually, through training, Tsukuyo slowly improves her ninjutsu. Now she looks up to Michiru and tries her best to become a better ninja.

SCHALE
Sensei
In the An Unconcealed Heart event, Michiru requested Sensei's help in making the Ninjutsu Research Development into a real club. Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy even with Schale's authority, but it was through this followed by a series of multiple events that Michiru learned to not only rely solely on herself but rather those around her as well, such as her clubmates.

Personality
A girl with a dream to let everyone know that ninjas are cool. Thanks to her dream and behavior, she is often ridiculed by others, causing her to sometimes have second thoughts when doing something ninja-related. Due to her passion of following her ninja dreams, she often only looks at the path that would seemingly lead her to being a better ninja, not considering other possibilities.

Appearance
Chidori Michiru has grey hair that fades into a dark greyish color, tied into twintails by two little black ribbons. She has golden eyes, a pair of grey Tanuki-like ears, and a grey Tanuki-like tail.

Halo
Her halo is has a light reddish color taking the form of a shuriken.

Uniform
Michiru wears a white tank to pwith a sarashi underneath it and a red and blue sailor-like ribbon above her chest, a black scarf around her neck that fades into a light red color, a pleated dark blue mini-skirt, a black obi around her waist with a big bow on it, thin black tekko on the arms, and black thighs, with her right thigh just reaching her knee. She is covered by some loose bandages around the knee area. Michiru also wears a kimono-like sleeve on her right arm.

Firearm
She uses a blue-pink gradient Remington 870 Express Tactical with a pink forend and stock, maroon cheek rest, and black breacher muzzle. A black KAC Masterkey underbarrel shotgun is also attached below of an already existing shotgun which seemed to be held by some purple bandages. White bandages are also wrapped around the stock and the receiver.
