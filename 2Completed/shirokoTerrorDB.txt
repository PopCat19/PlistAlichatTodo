Iridescence
Phrenapates
Spoilers!
Known as The False Sensei. Phrenapates is Shiroko Terror's Sensei from a different timeline who came into contact with the Iridescence. The two came into the current Kivotos seemingly to complete the Iridescence's will, but it turns out that it was all a plan devised by Phrenapates to entrust our Sensei with taking care of Shiroko Terror and Plana in hopes of giving them a better life.

SCHALE
Plana
Similar to Arona, Plana assists Phrenapates in leading Shiroko Terror during battle.

Sensei
Spoilers!
During the Ark of Atra-Hasis's self-destruct initiation, Sensei was tasked to help all the students present in the Ark evacuate using a limited-usage teleporter. While Phrenapates and Shiroko Terror stood defeated, Sensei used the last available use on Shiroko Terror to evacuate her safely, leaving only Sensei and Phrenapates onboard as the Ark exploded.
Countermeasures Committee
Sunaookami Shiroko
Spoilers!
After being evacuated safely from the Ark of Atra-Hasis, Shiroko Terror met with Shiroko. Although the two fought on the Ark beforehand, they put that aside and made amends with each other, even joking around saying that Hoshino will get mad at them if they begin robbing together.

Prologue
Shiroko Terror made her first appearance during Sensei's dream before waking up to Rin's calling.

Volume Final: Where All Miracles Begin
Chapter 1: Operation: Retake Schale
Sensei continued to have the exact same dream of Shiroko Terror appearing and shooting the Shittim Chest and Sensei. Sensei felt like it was a sign, so they asked for Seia's opinion about it. Surprisingly, Seia had been having the same dream as well.

Chapter 2: Operation: False Sanctum
After destroying the False Sanctums and their guardians, Kivotos felt a short period of relief. As Sensei was about to take a break, Shiroko Terror made her appearance in front of Sensei, threatening their life. She proposed that Sensei move as far away from Kivotos as possible or she will have to end their life. Suddenly, Schale's alarms rang and some students rushed in to Sensei's office. These students are Rin, Momoka, Ayumu, and Ayane. As Ayane showed up, Shiroko Terror turned speechless and decided to flee using a portal. Sensei instinctively jumped into the portal as well. On the other side, Sensei saw Shiroko Terror alongside a mysterious being. Sensei knew it was the Iridescent Vanguard, but they couldn't do anything about it as the mysterious being quickly knocked Sensei back through the portal and to their office.

Chapter 3: The Ark of Atrahasis
After a new problem arises, Sensei learns that the Iridescent Vanguard was Phrenapates which was located floating 75.000 altitude in the sky, Sensei meets Black Suit to ask for a solution to reach Phrenapates. He learns that the weapon( which was an intergalactic ship ) to reach Phrenapates was located in Kaiser excavation site. The Foreclosure Taskforce and Veritas Members ambushes Kaiser PMC for the weapon. After the students retrieve the Utnapishtim's Ship, Himari suggests inviting scholars from other academies to help pilot the ship with Nanagami Rin. They invite the Engineering Departmment, Hanako, Game Development Department, Ayane, Yuuka, Ako, and Kayoka, The Engineering Department discovers that the ship can assault the barriers surrounding The Ark of Atrahasis. Everybody's last night on the ground was filled with hope, and goodbyes. The ships operators dons their Operator uniforms, The Forclosure Taskforce were also invited in to the ship aswell as Gourmet Research Society and Fuuka, and departed afterwards. Arona warns Sensei that by using his body to power the ship, can may cause him to die, but Sensei dosen't hesitate and accepts what will happen. Everybody onboard realizes that they can't pass through the barrier, but Aris asks Kei to assist in destroying the barrier but Kei tries to stop her but ended up giving in, Kei uses Aris's Body to destroy the barrier using the Sword of Light, allowing the Students to get inside of the Ark

Profile
Shiroko from another timeline who crossed over along with Phrenapates. She is the same as Shiroko in this timeline, though a little more grown up. Shiroko deeply cares for Abydos and will do whatever it takes to rebuild the school and the region, though sometimes she shows her eccentric side.

Introduction
A mysterious student(?) whose appearance is unmistakably Sunaookami Shiroko's, but is not quite the same. A Nameless Goddess who made contact with the Iridescence, leading it to Kivotos, and consequently, Kivotos' demise.

Spoilers!
Known as the "God of Death - Anubis" (死の神〜アヌビス), this version of Shiroko was one who had fallen into despair after the loss of her friends and Sensei, subsequently making contact with the Iridescence and becoming the first Iridescent Vanguard member.

Advertisement
Personality
A visibly gloomy version of Shiroko who's most definitely affected by her past and present. Having suffered the loss of her loved ones, she came into the world to fulfill the role of bringing this world to its predetermined end. However, it seems she is still quite hesitant in doing so after knowing the existence of certain people.

Appearance
Shiroko (Terror) has misty-gray, waist-length hair, and a pair of wolf ears, sharing her hair color, as well as having white fluff on the inside. She has cyan eyes with heterochromia, having a white pupil on the left, and a black one on the right. She has vertical slit pupils. She has pale skin.

Halo
Her halo represents Shiroko's halo with pointed sides instead of the long rectangles Shiroko has. Her halo is black with a slight dark-green glow around the edges with shattered pieces on one section. On the illustration of its playable version, her halo has turned light blue, hinting that her mental state has healed somewhat, thanks to Sensei's guidance.

Uniform
She wears a black bustier dress, the skirt parting at her left thigh. The dress is long sleeved, with white cuffs, and a dark blue-green interior. A black choker is found around her neck, and a cyan T-shaped hairpin near her left temple. She wears dark grey high heels with straps, and a holster on her left thigh.

Firearm
She seems to be using the same firearms Shiroko uses with the exception that Shiroko (Terror)'s is repainted mostly black.
