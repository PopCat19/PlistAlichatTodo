Trinity Vigilante Crew
Morizuki Suzumi
A fellow member of the Trinity Vigilante Club who shares the same passion for upholding justice. In contrast to Reisa's recklessness, Suzumi acts more responsibly and always has to deal with the problems caused by Reisa.

After-School Sweets Club
Kyouyama Kazusa
A long time rival for Reisa. The only person Reisa could never beat in a duel ever since middle school. Despite Kazusa having taken a different approach in life than her old self, it took some time and convincing for Reisa to realize that Kazusa has changed for the better.
---
Backstory
The only information known about Reisa is she has been always "on a conquest of justice" since her middle school, where she always picks a fight with thugs around Kivotos. Among all thugs she has encountered, she claims she has defeated them all except Kyouyama Kazusa, which she calls as Cath Palug. She enrolled into Trinity High School and joins the Trinity Vigilante Crew with the same reason of defeating the thugs, and especially Kazusa, without realising Kazusa already quitted being a thug.

Event Story
A Tale of After-School Sweets
Uzawa Reisa appeared when Sensei was talking with Kazusa, where Kazusa pointed out Reisa was the stalker that followed her recently. Reisa immediately ambushed Kazusa, forcing Kazusa and Sensei to run far away from Reisa. After they are safely in Trinity campus, Kazusa revealed about her thug past and her affair with Reisa.

Sensei later met with Suzumi to know more about Reisa's behavior of "attack-first, think later" and as she is going to text Reisa to meet them together, Reisa texted her requesting for backup fighting the thugs. After fighting all the thugs together with Suzumi and Sensei, Reisa finally recognizes Sensei as "the person abducted by Kazusa". Reisa tried to explain her specific circumstances with Kazusa such as calling her Cath Palug, the undefeatable terror that used to haunt Kivotos (which is exaggerated for her thug history). However, Sensei revealed to Reisa that Kazusa has stopped being a thug and is now a normal student, letting Reisa left disappointed with that fact.

Some day after that, Reisa appeared when she encountered the After-School Sweets Club dressing as thugs (in order for Kazusa to feel in peace with her past, after meeting Sensei earlier). She challenged Kazusa again openly, which also reveals her past in the open, much to Kazusa's annoyance. Reisa, originally unconscious after the battle later heard about the argument between Kazusa and the club members, before witnessing Kazusa leaving the place.

Reisa met with Sensei later at night where she accepted the fact Kazusa is not a thug anymore, before some group of thugs came and attacked her. Together with Sensei, she fought back the thugs and realized that the incident during the day has triggered other thugs to target her. As an apology, she requested Sensei to send another "letter of challenge" to Kazusa, proclaiming she would not bother her anymore.

Sensei gives the letter to Kazusa, and as Kazusa thought something has happened to Reisa that led her to do this, they went to the back alleys and met other Sweets Club members. There, they found Reisa fighting the thugs alone. Kazusa stepped in by planting a bomb, which made Reisa unconscious in process, and the whole After School Dessert Club joins the fight and defeated the thugs. Reisa went unconscious until the next morning.

As Kazusa and Sensei gone back later after having a small talk, they met Reisa in the clubroom, surprising Kazusa. The situation was quite chaotic as Reisa keeps challenging Kazusa to fight her, with Sensei and the rest of the members only watched from the side.

Profile
A member of Trinity Integrated Academy's Vigilante Corps, who patrols all over Trinity and works to maintain public order.

People at times take her to be a mischievous child because Reisa says things that don't make sense, but she's more serious about the vigilante activities than anyone else around. She has a habit of referring to herself by different names.

Introduction
A hotheaded and headstrong girl belonging to Trinity's Vigilante Crew, who works hard to maintain security in Trinity. Even before becoming a highschooler, Reisa has enjoyed pouncing at delinquents she hears to be strong. Now a member of the Vigilante Crew, she takes her vigilante activities more seriously than anyone else. However, the way she says her name changes every time she comes forward...Apostle of Justice...Arbiter of Justice? The Knight of Trinity?

Personality
A strike-first, think-after type of person. She is, just like the other members of her club, eager to uphold justice although over-eagerness can lead to problems. She is also quite stuck in the past, refusing to believe that some things can and do change as time goes by.

Appearance
Reisa has waist length hair, consisting of uneven baby blue, and baby pink streaks. A purple star hairpin on her left. She has gray-ish blue eyes.

Halo
Reisa's halo has a pink star inside of another pink star, the latter having rounder edges.

Uniform
She wears a, gray sailor shirt with a white collar, black ribbon, and black buttons. A black coat on top, with white lines at the cuffs, and a bumch of badges close to the right shoulder. For legwear, she wears a grey pleated skirt with a black line along the bottom, a pair of boot socks, which are also blue and pink. The same applies to her shoes, which in addition have white soles, and toe caps, silver laces, and blue tounges.

Firearm
She uses a Standard Manufacturing DP-12 double-barreled pump action shotgun painted in pink, light blue, and yellow star patterns. The barrel, tube magazine, and sight rails retain their black finish.
