Hello, Sensei. It's Yuuka.

Yuuka
Do you remember me?
Reply
Of course I do.Whomst?

Yuuka
Well, that's a relief.

Yuuka
I'm glad I got your contact information earlier.
I had something important to discuss with you.
Schale still hasn't been reimbursed for the mission to reclaim the club room.

Yuuka
When will the invoice be sent out?
Was that a thing we were supposed to do?

Yuuka
Of course. Bullets aren't free.
Create an invoice and send it to the General Student Council.
They'll handle the rest.
How do I do that?

Yuuka
We use a standardized form at Millennium.
I'll bring you one the next time I visit Schale.
Thanks for your help.

Yuuka
It's no big deal.
Good day.

Sensei! Why is there a toy receipt included in the Schale invoice?
Buying toys has nothing to do with work!
Reply
But I needed it for work...Can't you let it slide this once?

Yuuka
No! Sensei, it's your job to set a good example for the students!
This invoice is a mess... I'm gonna redo it.

Yuuka
Wait... You didn't mess it up on purpose to get out of doing it, did you?
Senseeeiii!

Sensei, can you stop by the student office after school today?

Yuuka
I've got a problem that's even beyond me...
If you couldn't solve it, I doubt I can.

Yuuka
No, it's not like that.
What I really need is help from an adult!
If I can help, then I'll do my best.

Yuuka
Okay. I'll be waiting for you in the student office.

Seriously... Why can't the Trinity and Gehenna students take care of their equipment?
Why are you mad now?

Yuuka
What do you mean, now? Everyone's gonna think that I'm mad every day!

Yuuka
Look, about the Black Market contraband...
I investigated the source of the confiscated weapons...
It looks like they came from Trinity and Gehenna.

Yuuka
I've seen guns and even tanks with their school tags being traded.
I doubt the two academies are doing anything to manage their equipment.

Yuuka
The Millennium School is very strict about management,
so we never lose items like that!

Really?...

Sensei, you were late again this morning.

Yuuka
I know there's no one watching, but don't you think this is a poor example to set?
Reply
But I was up late last night because of work...I wouldn't be late if you came to wake me up every morning.

Yuuka
It's not okay to be late, even if you had a lot of work!

Yuuka
I think you've become too lax because school rules don't apply to Schale.
No more excuses! If you're late again tomorrow, you'll have to follow my orders!
Does that mean I can give you orders if YOU'RE late?

Yuuka
What? Why would I ever be late?
Just don't be late tomorrow. Please!

Sensei, I saw a game board in the Schale executive office.

Yuuka
If no one else is using it, could I borrow it?
I don't see why not. Do you like games?

Yuuka
Of course!
I love board games and online games.
I didn't expect that.

Yuuka
Well, shows how much you know about me.
I like games just as much as the other students.
Composing different strategies against difficult enemies is just as fun as solving math problems.

I feel like the world is made of numbers.
It makes me realize how people see numbers...

Maybe calling their world view dangerous would be too much but...
Yeah... I wouldn't say dangerous...

Yuuka
Well it's not that the world should run off of just numbers...

Yuuka
I'm more so trying to say...
If people could recognize the importance of numbers...

Yuuka
...maybe my work would be less burdensome. That's all.
Are the calculations off again?

Yes...
My calculator battery died.

Seminar
Ushio Noa
Working alongside Yuuka as Seminar's secretary, Yuuka and Noa has built quite a close friendship. Although Noa tends to tease Yuuka frequently given the opportunity, the two are relatively good friends.

Tsukatsuki Rio
Seminar's president. Due to lack of interaction, the relationship between the two are not good. After Yuuka found out about Rio's taking away of Alice and embezzlement of Seminar's funds, she sought to find Rio and make sure that she take responsibility for her actions.

C&C
Mikamo Neru
As Millennium's treasurer, Yuuka manages any financial business in Millennium, including operation costs for C&C. Due to Neru's destructive behavior, Yuuka frequently scolds Neru and the rest of C&C to be less reckless next time. Unfortunately, old habits die hard as Neru can't stop causing destruction during missions unless Sensei is with her.

Game Development Department
Yuuka and the Game Development Department have a love-hate relationship. Yuuka is frustrated by the Game Development Department's lackluster performance, while the Game Development Department viewed Yuuka as a demon lord that cut their funding. Nevertheless, Yuuka took care of the Game Development Department and played games together with them, maintaining a close relationship. In Get Set, Go! Kivotos Halo Games, Yuuka came as Yuzu's substitute in the borrowing game.

SCHALE
Sensei
Due to Sensei's childish behavior, Yuuka insists on looking after the teacher, especially when it comes to financials. She's often enraged by the teacher's outrageous spending on all sorts of toys and gacha games, and makes her disdain for that well-known. This extends to occasions such as aiding the Game Development Department during the Millenium arc, which led to all sorts of chaos within her school. She makes it a point to tell Sensei that SCHALE will be receiving a complaint from her soon after.

Despite that, Yuuka looks after Sensei and finds herself concerned over the educator's well-being.

Personality
Yuuka is generally polite, professional, and easy to deal with if you treat her well. However, most of the people she interacts with in the story are very difficult to deal with, which leads to angry outbursts. This earns her a reputation as cold and ruthless, even though she really isn't. She takes pride in her mathematical skills to the point of stubbornly refusing to believe in the randomness of a poker game with Sensei, allowing easy manipulation. She will also try to cover up her own mistakes due to her pride, such as when she pretended to spend less than 10000 yen on chocolate for Sensei by splitting the receipt.

When it comes to Sensei she is endlessly annoyed for having to take responsibility for their spending habits via accounting and telling them to spend less, but admires their determination to take care of the students and tactical prowess, causing feelings to develop.

Appearance
Yuuka has long, navy blue hair reaching to her waist with pigtails tied with a triangle device similar to her halo. She has bright blue eyes with red snake-like slits in her pupils.

Halo
Yuuka's halo is a black circle with blue line in the middle inside like a visor.

Uniform
She wears a standard uniform, along with a white and blue hoodie, a black and white blazer clipped with Millennium access badge, a tucked-in white shirt with blue tie underneath and a black pleated skirt. The latter styling a white belt with attached bullet pouches.

She wears sleeveless black gloves on both her hands, and a pair of black boots with blue tags.

Firearm
Yuuka UE Schematic
Logic & Reason

She uses a pair of black SIG MPXs with blue highlights on the handguard and the collapsing stock. A Millennium insignia is stamped on the mag well.
