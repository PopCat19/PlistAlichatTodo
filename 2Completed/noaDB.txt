Profile
Noa is the secretary of the student council "Seminar" at Millennium Science School. She has a very good memory and can memorize almost everything she sees or hears once, including decisions made at the "Seminar" and records of the contents of meetings.

She is briefly mentioned twice in Clockwork Flower Pavane.

Introduction
The secretary of the Millennium Academy Student Council, "Seminar". She possesses an incredible memory and serves as both record-keeper and patent attorney for student inventions. Her minimalist lifestyle and impartial observation skills make her an invaluable member of the council.

As a talented investigator, she notices details that others completely overlook, making her capable of uncovering information that would otherwise remain hidden. Her calm demeanor and subtle smile mask a playful personality that enjoys gentle teasing, particularly of her close friend Yuuka.

Personality
Noa is a helpful member of Seminar who utilizes her incredible memory to record nearly everything said during meetings, as well as details of locations she has been to that others may overlook entirely. This leaves her as a capable investigator in addition to an observer. She often poses a calming front and has a subtle smile that she holds for long periods with ease.

Noa has been friends with Yuuka for some time and periodically teases her, especially regarding her feelings towards Sensei. However, she is also the only member of Seminar capable of intimidating Koyuki into cooperation or compliance, suggesting there's more beneath her calm exterior than meets the eye.

Her hobbies include poetry, though she often uses complex or archaic terminology in her writing that can be difficult to understand. She lives as an ascetic, believing that a minimalist lifestyle contributes to her ability to be an impartial observer. Everything she owns is white, from her room decor to her personal belongings, reflecting her commitment to simplicity.

Despite her logical and rational approach to most situations, Noa has a hidden emotional side that occasionally surfaces during significant events. She struggles sometimes to express her true feelings, which can lead to misunderstandings with people like Koyuki who don't grasp her intentions.

When it comes to Sensei, she maintains professional courtesy while displaying a subtle interest in their activities and decision-making patterns. She often analyzes their behavior and finds their unpredictability both fascinating and worth documenting.

Appearance
Noa has ankle-length white hair cut into blunt bangs. Her eyes are a bright purple/magenta color. Her figure is soft and pronounced. A pair of mechanical devices resembling scouter lenses sit upon her ears, though their exact purpose remains unknown.

Halo
Her Halo resembles Yuuka's in its mechanical appearance. However, hers is white with a blue inner circle and a blue-colored portion on her right-hand side, distinguishing it from other Seminar members' halos.

Uniform
Noa's uniform consists of white and blue low heel boots, black tights, a pleated white skirt and blazer with a tech-adorned jacket hung over her arms. Underneath the blazer is a white dress-shirt and blue tie with her Millennium access card clipped onto the blazer's side pocket. Her color scheme predominantly features white and blue, matching her minimalist aesthetic preferences.

Firearm
She uses a white STI Apeiro 2011 handgun with a black grip. A white and blue Flux Raider brace is installed on the gun allowing it to act like a pistol-caliber carbine. The Millennium logo is imprinted near the stock, and the Tokyo Marui label is imprinted on the chassis just above the reserve magazine. This weapon is officially designated as "Secretary's Vote" (書記の採決).
