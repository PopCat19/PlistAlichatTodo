Personality
A helpful girl who wishes only the best for others and tries to help with whatever she can, sometimes to the point of overlooking her personal work limits.

Halo
Her halo is made up of a six petalled flower, surrounded by a circle. Said circle has six triangles sticking out, evenly spread. Her halo has a golden yellow gradient

Uniform

A golden bow at the lower back, golden patterned armbands, and gold ribbons around the cuffs. She has a black veil with a white underside over her head, with a golden headband.
