Profile
Plana (formerly known as A.R.O.N.A) is the main OS and system administrator of Phrenapates' "Shittim Chest", just before their death. After the events of Vol. F, she now resides in Sensei's very own Shittim Chest. She is a non-playable character, but appears in various game interfaces and plays a vital role in the game's story.

Introduction
The main OS of the Shittim Chest and Arona from another timeline. She is the manifestation of the damaged Shittim Chest from alternate timeline shot by Shiroko Terror, before reactivating when Phrenapates appeared.

Personality
Unlike Arona, despite also being the AI of the Shittim Chest, Plana generally spoke with simple commands, such as "understood." However, after parting with Phrenapates, she begins speaking more normally, though she often still speaks like a stereotypical computer AI by using simple formal response phrases. She calls Arona "Arona-senpai".

Appearance
Plana is a small girl with long white hair that extends below her waist and bangs cover her right eye. Her hair has a mild red gradient as it goes down, and she has a braid on her right side that looks like a double-helix with a red halo around where it's tied. She has dark gray irises, but her right pupil is very pale blue, while her left pupil is red.

Uniform
Plana wears a black sailor uniform with white piping on the edges of the collar that's tied with a white ribbon, a black pleated skirt that reaches just above her knees, black stockings, black loafers, and a long black coat.

Halo
Her halo is a simple red ring. Much like Arona, her halo changes depending on her mood.

Firearm
She appears to be carrying a long-ranged rifle, likely to be a two-toned black and white Pattern 1914 Enfield bolt action battle rifle, wrapped in black shroud, similarly to Shimoe Koharu's, though she is holding it by her two hands,
