Seminar
Hayase Yuuka
During Koyuki's runaway from Millennium in the Bunny Chaser on Board event, Yuuka was responsible for sending in C&C to capture her. Since Yuuka is Millennium's treasurer, she's also responsible for taking into account how much money was lost during the incident.

Advertisement
Ushio Noa
During VFC2E4, Koyuki was released from confinement in exchange for her help in dealing with the False Sanctums. For some reason, Koyuki follows Noa's orders but not Yuuka's.

Tsukatsuki Rio
In V2C2E12, it was speculated that Rio was responsible for sending in Koyuki as a way to distract Seminar and C&C during the Bunny Chaser on Board event while she stole funds from Millennium.

C&C
Although Koyuki and C&C are opposite sides, they seem to have a somewhat friendly relationship with each other due to their frequent encounters. C&C even knows Koyuki's codename "The White Rabbit."

Mikamo Neru
During the Bunny Chaser on Board event, Neru chased down Koyuki relentlessly due to how annoying Koyuki's been for her. With how angry and scary Neru seemed, Koyuki was basically running for her life.

Ichinose Asuna
During the Bunny Chaser on Board event, Asuna won an S-tier membership card despite Koyuki's countless attempts to get one, allowing her to do basically anything around the ship. This led to her freeing her fellow C&C members from custody. Koyuki's downfall was set the moment Neru was released.

Kakudate Karin
During the Bunny Chaser on Board event, Koyuki used a drone as her last resort on escaping from C&C. Unfortunately, she forgot that Karin is a well-trained sniper. As Karin fired, Koyuki fell into the ocean, causing her to almost drown.

SCHALE
Sensei
During the Bunny Chaser on Board event, Sensei was the very first adult Koyuki had ever seen. She was quite intrigued after seeing an adult for the first time. In her bond stories, Koyuki likes to unconver Sensei's secrets without their permission. However, at one moment, she had a rare moment of guilt and embarrassment when she discovered numerous adult magazines that were confiscated from other students.

Main Story
Volume 2: Clockwork Flower Pavane
When Yuuka found out about Rio's embezzlement, she questioned why it is not discovered earlier. Then, Akane mentioned Koyuki's own embezzlement back in Bunny Chaser on Board.

Profile
Genius girl from the Millennium Science School, Koyuki is a troublemaker member of the "Seminar" student council.

Koyuki is a prodigy when it comes to analyzing probabilities, although she herself is completely unaware of it. Koyuki likes games of chance, and constantly tries her luck in various ways. Even when she is in trouble, she never gives up.

Introduction
Koyuki is a troublemaker who has returned to Millennium's student council Seminar. She has a natural talent for deciphering mathematical codes, but she seems to be completely unaware of it...

A prodigious cryptanalyst who can crack even the toughest digital encryption systems through nothing more than her intuition. Due to the frequency of her encounters with C&C and her general harmlessness, Koyuki is somewhat on friendly terms with C&C and even calls the members of C&C "Senpai." Her nickname is "White Rabbit."


Advertisement
Personality
Arguably the most irresponsible known student in Kivotos. She seemingly never acknowledges her mistakes and almost always considers what she's doing to be right. This nature of hers causes numerous major problems for Millennium. She also often sticks her nose in other people's business, uncovering others' secrets without their permission simply for fun. Althrough, Koyuki expressed guilt and embarrassment when she discovered numerous adult magazines that were confiscated from other students.

Appearance
Koyuki has pink hair that's tied off into twintails. Her eyes are magenta with a large yellow sparkle. During her initial debut in Bunny Chaser on Board, Koyuki has pink and yellow hair that's tied off into low twintails and two buns.

Halo
Koyuki's halo is a pink circle with two spikes at opposite ends. In the center is a six-tooth cog.

Uniform
During the events of Bunny Chaser on Board, Koyuki wears a white tailcoat, a black leotard, a Millennium access badge, white tights, and black high heels. The inner side of her tailcoat is black with a pattern of yellow crosses. Around her neck is a detached collar and the standard Millennium necktie.

She wears white half-palm gloves and carries a white and black top hat that is yellow inside, though she does not wear. Instead, she wears a pair of black and yellow rabbit ears, completing her playboy bunny look.

Firearm
She uses a pink (formerly yellow or golden) M60E6 general-purpose machine gun with a black barrel and gas tube. An ammunition counter is present on the "drum" magazine. The Millennium insignia is imprinted on the stock and the magazine.
