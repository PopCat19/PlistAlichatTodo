It's not a lot, but it's about the amount you'd expect from a day of part-time work.
Maybe it's from a citizen who recognizes our accomplishments. Heeheehee.

Foreclosure Task Force
Compared to the other club members, Serika is quite gullible, often falling for scams and pyramid schemes, causing her other members to often sympathize for her.

SCHALE
Sensei
Similar to other students, Serika often asks Sensei to join her with her activities. This leads to Sensei frequently helping Serika out with her multiple part-time jobs. Since Sensei helped out too, they also get some payment, which they anonymously donated to the Foreclosure Task Force.

NPC
Shiba Seki
One of Serika's more well-known part-time jobs is at Shiba Seki Ramen, with her boss Shibaseki. Although Serika hasn't worked for him that long, they seem to be in good terms.

Profile
A student of Abydos High School, and the grouchy secretary of the Abydos Countermeasure Committee.

One with many complaints, Serika is the type hesitant to show her emotions.
Despite her daily habit of saying "It's fine if this school goes bankrupt", she has a deep love for her school and works tirelessly behind the backs of her clubmates to pay off her school's debt.

Introduction
A Treasurer working for the task force at the Countermeasure Committee for Abydos High.

Kuromi Serika has difficulty expressing her true emotions. Often short-tempered, but in reality, is kind. She works part-time at Shibaseki Ramen, a restaurant, using her wage to pay Abydos High’s debt.

Personality
Often short-tempered and angry, but hardworking and kind. She often invites Sensei to participate in her multiple part-time jobs.

Appearance
She has navy blue hair tied in long twintails reaching to her legs. She wears bright cyan ribbons and a speaker earpiece. She has dark blue cat ears.

Halo
Serika's halo has a red crosshair floating on top of her head with arrows on the outer ring.

Uniform
She wears a standard uniform, including a buttoned navy blue blazer with Abydos access badge, a white shirt and cyan tie underneath, and a pleated, plaid black skirt with black shorts.

Her hands are covered with black gloves with red on the palm area. She has a black knee wrap on her right leg, with similarly matching black socks and black and white sneakers with cyan shoelaces.

Firearm
