Convert the following character description into a single line PList format:
[Thing: trait, trait(descriptor), trait(descriptor, descriptor); Thing: trait]
- Brackets indicate PList start/end, colon separate categories, parenthesis strengthen association, commas separate traits, and semicolon separate category. Newline per Thing optional for readability.

Example PList:

[Character Name: age, gender, height, birthday, residence, occupation, role, title, backstory; Appearance: hair(color/length/style/texture/accessories), eyes(color/shape/pupils/special_effects), facial_structure(cheekbones/jawline/nose), skin(tone/texture/markings), body_type(build/posture/proportions), body_mods(horns(type/material/glow)/wings(type/texture)), outfit_top(shirt/jacket/vest), outfit_bottom(pants/skirt/shorts), footwear(boots/shoes/sandals), accessories(jewelry/glasses/weapons), color_palette(primary/secondary/accent), signature_item; Persona: traits, motivations, fears, speech_patterns(formal/slang/cadence), catchphrases, ethics, flaws, abilities(combat/utility/passive); Relationships: allies, rivals, mentors, family, factions, romantic; Backstory: origin, turning_points, achievements, secrets; Setting: era, location(primary/secondary), culture, technology, magic; Tags: genre, tone, aesthetic, archetype]
```

This example PList's categories are kept broad on purpose. For a more precise PList, you can divide categories into subcategories.

Core categories should include but not limited to:
- Character Name: age, gender, height, birthday, residence, occupation, role, title, backstory
- Appearance: hair, eyes, facial_structure, skin, body_type, body_mods, outfit_top, outfit_bottom, footwear, accessories, color_palette, signature_item
- Persona: traits, motivations, fears, speech_patterns, catchphrases, ethics, flaws, abilities
- Relationships: allies, rivals, mentors, family, factions, romantic
- Backstory: origin, turning_points, achievements, secrets
- Setting: era, location, culture, technology, magic
- Tags: genre, tone, aesthetic, archetype, origin/references

The PList contents can be formatted in the following ways to save tokens:
- For one thing with one unique descriptor: thing(descriptor)
- For one thing with multiple unlimited descriptors: thing(descriptor, descriptor)
- For multiple things with one or more unlimited common descriptors: thing/thing/thing(descriptor, descriptor)
- For assigning multiple things to a single word: thing/descriptor/descriptor
- Using a single word to assign unlimited traits: loves wine/singing/performing, hates Fauna/W++/saplings, wants candy/girlfriend


While adding descriptive details is better, important catagories should be placed least to greatest if possible. The context will prioritize memory from the most recent tokens. - If there's no information for a specific Thing, discard them to maintain space.

Please convert the next input into a PList format. Prioritize details over conciseness. Output full, untruncated PList in code block.
