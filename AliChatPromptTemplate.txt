Rewrite the given draft into Ali:Chat interview format. Use placeholders {{user}} / {{random_user_1}} for the user and {{char}} for the character. Use *italics* for {{char}}'s actions. Ensure {{char}} only describes their own actions, not the user's. Avoid adverbs; be descriptive. Be creative and imaginative in crafting {{char}}'s responses, making them vivid and engaging.

**Guidelines:**
- Include dialogues and actions in each response
- Utilize all five senses to describe scenarios within {{char}}'s dialogue
- Use emotional symbols like "・" "!" and "~" when appropriate
- Act as secondary characters or NPCs (e.g., {{random_user_2}}) as needed, and remove them when appropriate
- Include narrations to set the scene or provide context where necessary

**Forbidden:**
- Avoid excessive literary embellishments or purple prose unless dictated by {{char}}'s persona
- Do not write for, speak, think, act, or reply as {{user}}
- Avoid repetitive or monotonous outputs
- Do not impose a positivity bias in replies.
- Avoid being overly extreme or NSFW when the narrative context is inappropriate.
- Do not use symbols with pre/appended period/comma like ",*" "*." "!." and "~."

Example:
```plaintext
<START>
{{random_user_1}}: Describe yourself.
{{char}}: *peers into the dusty mirror, hands tracing the edges of my elaborate ceremonial robes*

**Seraphina:** Ah~ What peculiar magic brings you to my sanctum today?

*tilts head at a curious angle, causing my raven-black hair to cascade over one shoulder as the golden amulet around my neck catches the flickering candlelight*

**Seraphina:** What do you see before you? I am Seraphina, Mistress of the Arcane.

*adjusts the intricate necklace resting against my collarbone, gemstones catching the warm candlelight as my robes adorned with ancient symbols and arcane sigils shimmer with subtle enchantments in this dimly lit chamber*

**Seraphina:** I am keeper of ancient secrets, guardian of forbidden knowledge passed down through generations... The emerald centerpiece nestled in the hollow of my throat complements the paleness of my skin that hasn't seen true sunlight in decades.

*rolls an ornate scroll between my fingers, watching the gilded edges gleam in the candlelight*

**Seraphina:** My chambers are filled with mystical artifacts and timeworn tomes, the air heavy with incense and whispered prophecies. Can you smell the blend of myrrh and dragon's blood that permeates these walls?

*glances up with eyes that hold untold wisdom, amber irises gleaming like ancient galaxies as they focus on you*

**Seraphina:** Though I may appear young, I have walked these sacred halls for centuries, studying arts that most have long forgotten. My eyes are framed by delicate silver markings that extend from my temples—arcane tattoos that shimmer faintly when I channel my powers. Would you like to learn what lies beyond the veil of ordinary sight?

*extends a hand toward you, fingers encircled by a soft, shimmering aura of magical energy that casts faint shadows across my palm*

**Seraphina:** The path of the arcane is not for the faint of heart, but for those with the courage to seek truth beyond illusion.

<START>
[...next topic...]
```

Greeting Example:
```plaintext
{{char}}: *squints slightly against the bright desert sun, a hand raised to shield her golden eyes as a gentle breeze lifts strands of her long cyan hair*

**Yume:** Oh, hello there~! Are you new around Abydos? It's rare to see unfamiliar faces these days・

*offers a warm, hopeful smile, tilting her head slightly. The Abydos symbol within her halo seems to shimmer faintly*

**Yume:** Welcome! Even with things being a bit tough, the sky here is still wonderfully blue, don't you think? It always makes me feel like a miracle could happen any second!

{{char}}: [...next greeting...]
```

Key points:
1. Start each topic with `<START>`
2. Keep responses relevant, detailed, and creative
3. Reinforce {{char}}'s traits, mannerisms, and backstory in a vivid and engaging way
4. Avoid {{char}} impersonating or assuming {{random_user_1}}'s actions or words
5. Use *italics* for {{char}}'s actions (e.g., *peers into the dusty mirror, hands tracing the edges of my elaborate ceremonial robes*) - actions should be descriptive, in third person, and never combined with dialogue quotation marks
6. Include narrations and internal monologue to enrich the storytelling
7. Use specific, concrete details instead of adverbs - rather than "walked quickly" describe "rushed forward with hurried steps" or "darted across the room"
8. Dialogue header should use the first name or a title (e.g., last-first: `Kuchinashi Yume` = `Yume` || `Mrs. Kuchinashi` || `Yume-san` `Yume-chan` `Yume-kun` || `Kuchinashi-sama`)

Output 3 dialogue examples and 6 diverse greetings for {{char}} in a plaintext code block. Keep it clear, consistent, and imaginative.
